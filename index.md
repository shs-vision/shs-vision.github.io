## About Me

I'm a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Robotic Cognition & Manipulation Lab](https://rilab.hanyang.ac.kr) in Hanyang University.
I received the B.S. degree in 2015, the M.S. degree in 2017, and the Ph. D. in 2023 in Electrical Engineering from Hanyang University, Republic of Korea. 
I was a Visiting Scholar at KU Leuven, Belgium in 2020. 
Since 2023, I have been a BK Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Research Institute of Engineering and Technology, Hanyang University, Republic of Korea. 
Since 2025, I have been working as a Research Assistant Professor at the same institute.
My research interests focus on developing autonomous systems for advanced capabilities in complex environments including robotic noninvasive brain stimulation, object pose estimation, multi-sensor fusion and robotic grasping.
